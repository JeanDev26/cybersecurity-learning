### Creating a File Using the Shell in Linux
In Linux, files can be created directly from the command-line shell.  
- Common commands include:  
  - `touch filename` → Creates an empty file.  
  - `echo "text" > filename` → Creates a file with content or overwrites an existing one.  
  - `nano filename` or `vi filename` → Opens a text editor in the shell to create or edit a file.  
- Demonstrates the power of the command line for file management tasks.  
- Useful in scripting, automation, and server environments without graphical interfaces.
