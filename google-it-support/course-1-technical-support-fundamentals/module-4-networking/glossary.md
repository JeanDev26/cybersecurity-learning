### Computer Network
A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, smartphones, IoT devices) that communicate and share resources.  
- Devices are connected through **wired** (Ethernet, fiber optic) or **wireless** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) technologies.  
- Networks enable data sharing, Internet access, file transfer, and communication.  
- Classified by scale: **LAN (Local Area Network)**, **WAN (Wide Area Network)**, **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**, and **PAN (Personal Area Network)**.  
- Require hardware (routers, switches, access points) and software (protocols, services) to function.  

---

### Client
A **client** is a device or software application that requests services or resources from a server.  
- Examples: a web browser accessing a website, an email app connecting to a mail server.  

---

### Server
A **server** is a computer or software system that provides services, data, or resources to clients over a network.  
- Types: web servers, mail servers, file servers, database servers.  

---

### Internet Service Provider (ISP)
An **ISP** is a company that provides users with access to the Internet.  
- Connects local networks (home, office) to the global Internet.  
- ISPs allocate **IP addresses** and may provide DNS and email services.  

---

### IP Address
An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.  
- Types: **IPv4** (32-bit) and **IPv6** (128-bit).  
- Can be static (fixed) or dynamic (assigned by DHCP).  

---

### MAC Address
A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC).  
- Used to identify devices in a local network.  
- Consists of 48 bits (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).  

---

### Ethernet and Wi-Fi
**Ethernet** is a wired networking technology using cables (usually twisted pair or fiber).  
**Wi-Fi** is a wireless networking technology using radio waves.  
- Both allow devices to connect to a local area network (LAN).  

---

### Fiber Optic Cable
A **fiber optic cable** transmits data as pulses of light through glass or plastic fibers.  
- Provides high bandwidth and long-distance communication.  
- Faster and more reliable than copper cables.  

---

### Router
A **router** is a device that directs data packets between networks.  
- Connects local networks to the Internet via the ISP.  
- Performs functions such as NAT and firewalling.  

---

### Data Packet Transmission
A **data packet** is the basic unit of communication in a network.  
- Inside a LAN: travels from one device to another via switches/routers.  
- To another city: passes through the router â†’ ISP â†’ Internet backbone â†’ destination ISP â†’ destination device.  

---

### Network Stack
The **network stack** is the set of communication layers (e.g., OSI model, TCP/IP model) that define how data is transmitted.  
- Layers include physical, data link, network, transport, and application.  

---

### Splitters
A **splitter** is a device that divides a signal into multiple outputs.  
- Used in telephone lines, fiber optics, and cable TV.  

---

### Hub
A **hub** is a simple network device that broadcasts data to all connected devices.  
- Less efficient than switches, as it does not filter traffic.  

---

### TCP/IP Protocol
**TCP/IP** is the core suite of protocols for the Internet.  
- TCP ensures reliable transmission.  
- IP handles addressing and routing.  

---

### Web
The **World Wide Web (WWW)** is a system of interlinked documents accessed through the Internet using browsers.  
- Uses protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS.  

---

### Website
A **website** is a collection of web pages accessible under a domain name.  

---

### URL
A **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** specifies the address of a resource on the web.  
- Parts include protocol (https://), domain (example.com), path (/page), and query string (?id=1).  

---

### ICANN
**ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)** is the organization that manages domain names and IP address allocation globally.  

---

### IPv4 and IPv6
- **IPv4**: 32-bit addressing (â‰ˆ 4.3 billion addresses).  
- **IPv6**: 128-bit addressing (â‰ˆ 340 undecillion addresses), created to replace IPv4.  

---

### NAT
**Network Address Translation (NAT)** allows multiple devices in a private network to share one public IP address.  
- Commonly implemented in routers.  

---

### Internet of Things (IoT)
**IoT** refers to everyday devices connected to the Internet (e.g., smart home devices, sensors).  

---

### COPPA
**Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** is a U.S. law that regulates online services directed at children under 13, ensuring data protection and parental consent.  

---

### Copyright
**Copyright** protects the intellectual property of creators (text, software, images, music).  

---

### Privacy and Security
Refers to the protection of user data and systems from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure.  

---

### DNS
**Domain Name System (DNS)** translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.  

---

### ARPANET
**ARPANET** was the first operational packet-switching network, precursor to the modern Internet.  

---

### DARPA
**DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)** is the U.S. agency that funded ARPANET and other pioneering technologies.  

---

### Globalization
In the context of networking, **globalization** refers to how the Internet connects people, economies, and cultures worldwide.  

---

### Internet
The **Internet** is the global network of interconnected computers that use TCP/IP protocols to communicate.  

---

### Server Logs
**Server logs** are files that record events, requests, errors, and activities happening on a server.  

---

### Switch
A **switch** is a network device that forwards data to the correct device based on MAC addresses.  
- More efficient than hubs.  

---

### World Wide Web
The **World Wide Web (WWW)** is the system of websites and content accessible via the Internet using browsers.
