### Software
A set of instructions, programs, or data that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks.  
- Divided into **system software**, **application software**, and **firmware**.  

---

### Coding
The process of writing instructions (code) that computers can interpret and execute.  

---

### Scripting
A form of coding used to automate repetitive tasks or control existing applications.  

---

### Script
A small program written in a **scripting language** (e.g., Bash, Python, PowerShell) that automates tasks.  

---

### Programming
The process of designing and building software using **programming languages**.  
- Produces applications, systems, and services.  

---

### Programming Languages
Formal languages used to communicate instructions to a computer.  
- Examples: Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, Bash.  
- Categories: scripting, compiled, assembly.  

---

### Copyright
A legal right that protects creators of original works, including **software**.  
- Prevents unauthorized use, copying, or distribution.  

---

### Open-Source Software
Software with publicly available source code.  
- Users can view, modify, and distribute it.  
- Examples: Linux, Apache, Git.  

---

### Application Software
Programs designed for end users.  
- Examples: browsers, word processors, media players.  

---

### System Software
Software that manages hardware and provides a platform for applications.  
- Examples: operating systems, device drivers.  

---

### Firmware
Permanent software programmed into hardware devices.  
- Provides low-level control (e.g., BIOS, router firmware).  

---

### Software Versions
Numbered releases that identify stages of development.  
- Example: v1.0 (initial release), v2.0 (major update).  
- Can include **patches** and **updates**.  

---

### Assembly Language
A low-level programming language close to machine code.  
- Uses mnemonics (e.g., MOV, ADD) instead of binary instructions.  

---

### Compiled Programming Languages
Languages that must be translated (compiled) into machine code before execution.  
- Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go.  
- Faster performance than interpreted scripts.  

---

### Software Bug
An error, flaw, or unintended behavior in a program.  
- Bugs can cause crashes, vulnerabilities, or incorrect results.  

---

### Git
A **version control system (VCS)** used to track changes in code and collaborate in software projects.  
- Distributed and open-source.  

---

### .exe
A Windows **executable file** format.  
- Contains compiled code that runs as a program.  

---

### Automation
The use of software or scripts to perform tasks without manual intervention.  
- Examples: backups, software installation, updates.  

---

### Install, Remove, and Update Software (Windows)
- **Install**: use `.exe` installers or package managers (e.g., Winget, Chocolatey).  
- **Remove**: via Control Panel, Settings, or `winget uninstall`.  
- **Update**: built-in updater or package manager.  

---

### Install, Remove, and Update Software (Linux)
- **Install**: use package managers (`apt install`, `dnf install`).  
- **Remove**: `apt remove`, `dnf remove`.  
- **Update**: `apt update && apt upgrade`, `dnf update`.
