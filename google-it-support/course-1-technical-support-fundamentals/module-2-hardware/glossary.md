# Glossary â€” Module 2: Hardware

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** the brain of the computer that executes instructions.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** volatile memory used for temporary data storage.
- **Motherboard:** the main circuit board that connects all components.
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit):** converts electricity from outlet to usable power for the PC.
- **I/O Devices:** peripherals for input (keyboard, mouse) and output (monitor, printer).

## ðŸ§  CPU Cache Levels

- **L1 Cache (Level 1):**  
  - The fastest and smallest cache, located inside each CPU core.  
  - Stores the most frequently used instructions and data.  
  - Typically between 16 KB and 128 KB.  

- **L2 Cache (Level 2):**  
  - Larger but slower than L1.  
  - Can be dedicated per core or shared between cores.  
  - Usually ranges from 256 KB to a few MB.  

- **L3 Cache (Level 3):**  
  - Shared across all cores in a multi-core CPU.  
  - Much larger but slower compared to L1 and L2.  
  - Improves performance by reducing main memory (RAM) access.
