# Glossary â€” Module 2: Hardware

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** the brain of the computer that executes instructions.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** volatile memory used for temporary data storage.
- **Motherboard:** the main circuit board that connects all components.
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit):** converts electricity from outlet to usable power for the PC.
- **I/O Devices:** peripherals for input (keyboard, mouse) and output (monitor, printer).
- **Hard Drive:** Holds all our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, applications
- **Desktop Computer:**  
  A personal computer designed to fit on or under a desk.  
  Typically consists of a separate monitor, keyboard, mouse, and a tower or case containing the main hardware components (CPU, RAM, storage, motherboard, power supply).  
  Desktops usually allow easier hardware upgrades compared to laptops.

## ðŸ§  CPU Cache Levels

- **L1 Cache (Level 1):**  
  - The fastest and smallest cache, located inside each CPU core.  
  - Stores the most frequently used instructions and data.  
  - Typically between 16 KB and 128 KB.  

- **L2 Cache (Level 2):**  
  - Larger but slower than L1.  
  - Can be dedicated per core or shared between cores.  
  - Usually ranges from 256 KB to a few MB.  

- **L3 Cache (Level 3):**  
  - Shared across all cores in a multi-core CPU.  
  - Much larger but slower compared to L1 and L2.  
  - Improves performance by reducing main memory (RAM) access.  

  ## ðŸ”Œ Ports and Connectors

- **USB (Universal Serial Bus):**  
  Standard connection used for peripherals like keyboards, mice, external drives.  
  - USB-A: traditional rectangular connector.  
  - USB-C: smaller, reversible, supports power delivery and fast data transfer.  

- **Ethernet (RJ-45):**  
  Port used to connect computers to wired networks. Provides faster and more stable connection than Wi-Fi.  

- **HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface):**  
  Transmits high-quality video and audio from the computer to monitors, TVs, and projectors.  

- **DisplayPort:**  
  Similar to HDMI but often used in monitors for higher resolutions and refresh rates.  

- **Audio Jack (3.5mm):**  
  Port for headphones, microphones, and speakers.  

- **VGA (Video Graphics Array):**  
  Older video port used for monitors and projectors. Largely replaced by HDMI and DisplayPort.  

- **Thunderbolt:**  
  High-speed port (often using USB-C shape) for data transfer, video output, and power delivery.
