# ðŸ“˜ Glossary â€“ Module 3: Operating System

### Operating System (OS)
System software that manages hardware resources and provides services for applications.  
Functions include process management, memory management, file systems, input/output device control, user interaction, and security.  
Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS, Chrome OS, Android, iOS.

### Components of an Operating System
The main modules that make up an OS, responsible for managing and coordinating system resources:  
- **Kernel**: Core of the OS, controls CPU, memory, and device drivers.  
- **Process Management**: Schedules and handles the execution of processes.  
- **Memory Management**: Allocates RAM and manages virtual memory.  
- **File System Management**: Organizes, stores, and retrieves data.  
- **I/O Management**: Handles communication between hardware devices and applications.  
- **User Interface**: Provides ways for users to interact with the OS (CLI or GUI).  

### Different Types of Operating Systems
Operating systems vary according to their target devices and use cases:  

- **Windows**: Widely used desktop OS developed by Microsoft. Known for user-friendly GUI, broad software support, and enterprise usage.

- **Chrome OS**: Lightweight OS by Google, based on Linux and designed for web/cloud-based applications.  

### Files
A file is a collection of data stored on a computer system.  
- Can contain text, images, audio, video, or software instructions.  
- Identified by a file name and extension (e.g., `report.docx`, `photo.png`).  
- Managed by the operating system through the file system.  

### Folders (Directories)
A folder, also called a directory, is a container used to organize files and other folders.  
- Helps structure data storage in a hierarchical way.  
- Allows grouping of related files together.  
- Examples: `Documents`, `Downloads`, `Pictures`.  

### Kernel
The **kernel** is the core component of an operating system.  
- It operates at the lowest level of the OS, directly interacting with hardware.  
- Responsible for managing CPU, memory, and device drivers.  
- Provides essential services such as process scheduling, resource allocation, and hardware abstraction.  
- Types of kernels include **monolithic kernels** (all services in one layer) and **microkernels** (minimal core, services run in user space).  

### File Systems
A **file system** is the method and structure that an operating system uses to organize, store, and retrieve files on a storage device.  
- Defines how data is named, stored, and accessed.  
- Common file systems include **NTFS** (Windows), **FAT32** (older Windows and external drives), **ext4** (Linux), **APFS** (macOS), and **HFS+** (older macOS).  
- Provides features such as permissions, metadata, directories, and indexing.  
- Plays a crucial role in performance, reliability, and security of data storage.  

### Block Storage
**Block storage** is a data storage method where data is stored in fixed-size units called *blocks*.  
- Each block has a unique address, and the operating system retrieves or writes data by addressing these blocks.  
- Commonly used in hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and SAN (Storage Area Networks).  
- Provides high performance and flexibility since files are split into blocks that can be distributed across disks.  
- File systems are built on top of block storage to provide structure and organization.  

### Metadata
**Metadata** is data that provides information about other data.  
- In file systems, metadata describes file attributes such as name, size, type, creation date, modification date, and permissions.  
- Helps the operating system manage, organize, and search files efficiently.  
- Does not contain the fileâ€™s actual content but essential details for identification and access control.  

### File Extension
A **file extension** is the suffix at the end of a file name that indicates its format and the type of data it contains.  
- Usually consists of 2â€“4 characters after a dot (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.exe`).  
- Helps the operating system determine which program should open the file.  
- Some file extensions are associated with specific applications, while others are standard across multiple platforms.  

### Process Management
**Process Management** is a core function of the operating system that handles the execution of programs.  
- Creates, schedules, and terminates processes.  
- Allocates CPU time and system resources to active processes.  
- Ensures multitasking by managing process states (ready, running, waiting).  
- Uses scheduling algorithms to balance efficiency and fairness.  

### Time Slice
A **time slice** (also called a time quantum) is the fixed amount of CPU time allocated to a process in a multitasking operating system.  
- Determines how long a process can run before the CPU switches to another process.  
- Used in preemptive scheduling to ensure fair CPU sharing among processes.  
- The length of the time slice affects performance:  
  - Too short â†’ overhead from frequent context switching.  
  - Too long â†’ poor responsiveness for other processes.  

### Virtual Memory
**Virtual memory** is a memory management technique that gives applications the illusion of having a large, continuous block of memory, regardless of the physical RAM available.  
- Uses both RAM and disk storage to extend available memory.  
- Allows multiple programs to run simultaneously without interfering with each other.  
- Implements mechanisms like **paging** and **segmentation** to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.  
- Can reduce performance when excessive disk swapping occurs, a situation known as **thrashing**.  

### I/O Devices
**Input/Output (I/O) devices** are hardware components that allow a computer system to communicate with the external world.  
- **Input devices**: Send data to the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone).  
- **Output devices**: Receive data from the computer (e.g., monitor, printer, speakers).  
- **Storage devices**: Can serve as both input and output (e.g., hard drives, SSDs, USB drives).  
- Managed by the operating system through **device drivers**, which provide the interface between hardware and software.  

### Shell
A **shell** is a user interface that allows interaction with the operating system by entering commands.  
- Acts as a bridge between the user and the OS kernel.  
- Can be **command-line based** (CLI), such as Bash, PowerShell, or Zsh.  
- Can also be **graphical** (GUI shells), providing windows, icons, and menus for interaction.  
- Interprets user commands and translates them into actions performed by the OS.  

### Logs
**Logs** are records automatically generated by an operating system or applications to document events, activities, and errors.  
- Help administrators monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues.  
- Common types include **system logs**, **application logs**, and **security logs**.  
- Typically stored as plain text files and managed by logging services (e.g., syslog in Linux, Event Viewer in Windows).  
- Provide valuable information for auditing and detecting anomalies.  

### Bootloader
A **bootloader** is a small program that runs when a computer is powered on and is responsible for loading the operating system into memory.  
- Initializes hardware components and prepares the system for the OS.  
- Typically stored in the systemâ€™s firmware or on the first sector of a storage device.  
- Examples include **GRUB** (Linux) and **Windows Boot Manager**.  
- Without a bootloader, the operating system cannot start.  

### Boot Process
The **boot process** is the sequence of steps a computer follows to start the operating system after being powered on:  

1. **Power On** â†’ The system receives electrical power and begins startup.  
2. **BIOS/UEFI** â†’ Firmware initializes hardware components and runs the **POST (Power-On Self-Test)** to check system health.  
3. **Boot Device Selection** â†’ The firmware locates a valid boot device (e.g., hard drive, USB, CD/DVD).  
4. **Bootloader** â†’ A small program on the boot device that loads the operating system into memory.  
5. **Operating System (OS)** â†’ Once loaded, the OS takes control and provides the user environment.
