# ðŸ“‘ Summary - The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking

## Key concepts of Module 1

1. **TCP/IP Model (5 layers)**  
   - Physical Layer â†’ bits transmitted through cables/fiber/radio.  
   - Data Link Layer â†’ MAC addresses, Ethernet, switches.  
   - Network Layer â†’ IP addresses, routing, ICMP.  
   - Transport Layer â†’ TCP (reliable), UDP (fast).  
   - Application Layer â†’ HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP, etc.  

2. **OSI vs TCP/IP**  
   - OSI: 7 layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).  
   - TCP/IP: 5 layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Application).  
   - Mapping: Session + Presentation are grouped into Application in TCP/IP.  

3. **Networking Devices**  
   - Hub â†’ sends data to all.  
   - Switch â†’ sends data to the correct destination (MAC).  
   - Router â†’ connects different networks (IP).  

4. **Addresses and transmissions**  
   - MAC = physical address.  
   - IP = logical address.  
   - Types: Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast.  

5. **Ethernet Frame**  
   - Source MAC, Destination MAC, EtherType, Data, CRC.  

6. **Protocols and Services**  
   - **DNS** â†’ translates domain names into IP addresses.  
   - **DHCP** â†’ automatically assigns IP addresses and network configurations.  
   - **ARP** â†’ maps IP addresses to MAC addresses within a LAN.  
   - **ICMP** â†’ diagnostics and error messages (e.g., `ping`).  

7. **Cabling Tools**  
   - Crimper, Punch Down Tool, Cable Tester, Toner, Multimeter.  
   - Common cabling types: Cat5e, Cat6, fiber optic.
