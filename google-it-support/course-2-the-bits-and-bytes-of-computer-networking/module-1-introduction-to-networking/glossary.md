# ðŸ“˜ Glossary - The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking

- **Bit**: The smallest unit of data, 0 or 1.  
- **Byte**: A group of 8 bits.  
- **MAC Address**: A unique physical address of a network interface card (6 octets).  
- **IP Address**: A logical address used to identify devices in a network.  
- **Broadcast Address**: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`, used to send data to all devices on the local network.  
- **CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Check)**: An error-detection technique used in Ethernet frames.  
- **Unicast**: One-to-one communication.  
- **Broadcast**: One-to-all communication.  
- **Multicast**: One-to-many (specific group) communication.  
- **Ethernet Frame**: A structured data unit used in Ethernet transmission, containing source MAC, destination MAC, type, data, and CRC.  
- **Switch**: A device that forwards frames based on MAC addresses.  
- **Router**: A device that forwards packets between different networks (based on IP).  
- **Patch Panel**: A device used to organize network cables in racks.  
- **Punch Down Tool**: A tool used to secure wires into patch panels or keystones.  
- **Crimper**: A tool used to crimp RJ-45 connectors onto cables.

### ðŸ”¹ Additional Networking Terms

- **Duplex (Half/Full)**:  
  - *Half duplex*: allows sending or receiving, but not at the same time.  
  - *Full duplex*: allows simultaneous sending and receiving.  

- **Port**:  
  - A numeric identifier used at the transport layer to distinguish services (e.g., 80 = HTTP, 443 = HTTPS).  

- **Subnet**:  
  - A logical subdivision of an IP network.  
  - Uses a subnet mask to determine which devices are in the same segment.  

- **Gateway**:  
  - A device (usually a router) that connects the local network to external networks, such as the Internet.  

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:  
  - Protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to devices on the network.  

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**:  
  - Translates domain names (e.g., `www.google.com`) into IP addresses.  

- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:  
  - Maps an IP address to a MAC address within a local network.  

- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**:  
  - Used for diagnostics and error reporting in networks (example: the `ping` command).
