# ðŸ§ª Examples - The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking

## Practical examples learned

- **IP and MAC addresses**:  
  Example: `192.168.1.10` (private IP) corresponds to MAC `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
  
- **Unicast vs Broadcast vs Multicast**:  
  - Unicast: PC A â†’ PC B  
  - Broadcast: PC A â†’ Everyone on the LAN  
  - Multicast: PC A â†’ Specific group of PCs
  
- **Physical Layer**:  
  - Cat 5e Ethernet cable carrying electrical signals.  
  - Fiber optic cable transmitting pulses of light.  

- **Networking Tools**:  
  - Punch Down Tool: used to secure cables into a patch panel.  
  - Crimper: used to attach cables into RJ-45 connectors.  
  - Cable tester: ensures that the cable was assembled correctly.  
  - Toner: identifies a specific cable among many.  
  - Multimeter: measures if PoE (Power over Ethernet) is being supplied.  

- **TCP vs UDP**:  
  - TCP Example: Downloading a file â†’ requires reliability and ordered delivery.  
  - UDP Example: Video call â†’ faster but can tolerate some packet loss.  

- **DNS in action**:  
  - Input: `www.google.com`  
  - Resolution: `142.250.190.14`.  

- **ARP in action**:  
  - PC asks: "Who has IP 192.168.0.5?"  
  - The device with that IP responds with its MAC address.
